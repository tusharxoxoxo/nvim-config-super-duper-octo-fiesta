Major areas include:

Prerequisite: install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

## xdg_config

This area contains configuration I want to share between machines that will go to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (generally, `~/.config`).


Subdirectories include:

### Neovim

Check the `nvim` folder for configuration. For more instruction, see the README there.
